brainpass
=========

Utility webpage to generate per-site passwords from a master passphrase, without needing external data. Similar to how brainwallet works.

TODOs:
- CLEANUP
- webworker to do in the background
- is there a way to incrementally hash?
- local storage stores websites for me
- random passphrase generator
 - different languages
- verifier to make sure we typed the correct password
- Use iframe sandbox
