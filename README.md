brainpass
=========

Utility webpage to generate per-site passwords from a master passphrase, without needing external data. Similar to how brainwallet works.

TODOs:
- local storage stores websites for me, allow exporting to JSON
- random passphrase generator
 - different languages
 - Choose how long password can be
- verifier to make sure we typed the correct password
- Use iframe sandbox
- Provide a default list of sites
- Expose password length
- Expose hash iteration count / algorithm
